5GIF Evaluation Group is an Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) for the IMT-2020 candidate technology for ITU-R. We are one of the few groups registered to carry out evaluation activities for candidate technologies submitted for IMT-2020.

[IMT-2020 Process and Evaluation Home Page](https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-R/study-groups/rsg5/rwp5d/imt-2020/Pages/submission-eval.aspx)

The group members are from Industry, Academia and Operators. The documents and software development are collaborated through `github`.

If you are interested in joining the Evaluation Activity, please write to imt2020[@]5gindiaforum.in 

Repository of documents from 3GPP and ITU workshops related to IMT2020 evaluation. It is made available more of convienience to refer and pull in the developmentwork.

# Key ITU-R IMT-2020 documents

* [M.2410](/docs/M.2410-TPR.pdf) : Minimum requirements related to technical performance for IMT-2020 radio interface(s)  

* [M.2412](/docs/M.2412-EVAL.pdf) : Guidelines for evaluation of radio interface technologies for IMT-2020   
This Report provides guidelines for the `procedure, the methodology` and the criteria (technical, spectrum and service) to be used in `evaluating the candidate IMT-2020 radio interface` technologies (RITs) or Set of RITs (SRITs) for a number of test environments. These test environments are chosen to simulate closely the more stringent radio operating environments. The evaluation procedure is designed in such a way that the overall performance of the candidate RITs/SRITs may be fairly and equally assessed on a technical basis. It ensures that the overall IMT 2020 objectives are met.

* [M.2411](docs/M.2411.SUBMISSION.pdf) : Requirements, evaluation criteria and submission templates for the development of IMT-2020  This Report deals with on the requirements, evaluation criteria and submission templates for the development of Recommendations and Reports on IMT-2020, such as the detailed specifications of IMT 2020.
